# Description

FEEDBACK RK: Mehr auf Struktur, Strategie, Workflow für große Gruppen

What can you do when courses, learning modules, tests and files grow to such a number that users get lost? Is ILIAS just so complex that using it has to feel intimidating? When users started to miss important new content and dreaded navigating through the system, we had to act:

With our corporate clients, we developed a modular, easy-to-use system to design professional, sleek and helpful pages. With clear structures and a clean design we make even the largest learning catalogs feel welcoming and light.

In this presentation, Concepts and Training GmbH (a certified ILIAS service provider focusing on bringing the power of ILIAS to medium and large companies) talks tips and tricks for building high quality pages consistently and effectively:
* What ILIAS pages can and can't do for your users
* Design and structures for a better overview
* How we broke the limits of the ILIAS page editor

At the end of the presentation, we also share a handy checklist with our guidelines for building more helpful and effective pages.

# Content Outline

## Intro

* the problem: ILIAS can be large and overwhelming
* the consequence: users miss important new content, users use the system less
* escalation: some of our clients need their users to get certificates and IDD credits required by law - how do we make something people have to do more to something they like to do? Don't want to battle software on top of your mandatory training.

## Analyzing the problem

* Dashboard: Not right for us as an entry point, because...
* Just lists of objects in the repository: Frustrating and boring
* Distinguishing between content and navigation pages

## What do we aim for?

* This is mainly for the consuming user, with the managing user building it
* The user
    * Quick orientation: I know where I have to go
    * Recognition: This is the pattern, I know this
* The managing user
    * overcoming fear of the empty page
    * unifying different skill levels and taste
* end goal: effective tools/workflows to build "good" pages
    * library of page templates
    * library of blocks
    * (showing some of the coolest blocks and page templates here as a teaser)

## Page Editor 101

* content styles
* where ILIAS sets the bar
* where we wanted to the bar to be
* styling beyond the content style form

## The blocks

* every block should serve a purpose
    * when/why to use it
    * when/how not to use it
    * familiar concept to the user (e.g. from websites)
    * company CI

## Beratung Strategy
    * trotz Bereiche aus einem Guss
    * avoid wild styling
    * inline styling
    * wild styling with image
    * nicht benutzen wie Word, gezielter entwickelte Design Element

## Tipps
    * Kategorien nach Personengruppe
    * See content styles and system styles not as separate e.g. Using CI colors in page editor
    * Study Program

## The page templates
* vorbereiten
* bekannt machen

## Some trouble and limitations

* Nested Blocks
* Multi-style
* css with skin
* "just copy this"-rule

## Conclusion / Checklist for a good navigation page
