* Properties blend together {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* most of the text properties: same size, color, place {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* takes time to locate the relevant date {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

---

The property area holds all kinds of things:

## Feature Request for Catalogue View

---

![](./img/FR-item-catalogue-view.png)

* properties still blending together {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* which properties get an icon or a color? {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* Do they always get that icon or color? {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* What's the best order? {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* How do we identify the "right" decisions? {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

---

## Guidelines?

---

Criterias to make the best decisions for the

* positioning {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* grouping {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* formatting {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

of properties on items (objects with properties) {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

---

to maximize

* readability
* ease of use

---

## Research

---

### Collecting

What

* types of properties
* design and layouts for properties

already exist in ILIAS?

---

Very helpful table in FR: Streamline Object Properties

### Workshop at CaT

Developers and product managers discussing UX challenges with properties

Issues from their own experience or reports from users:

---

* irrelevant information when looking for a specific property

---

* empty space (in particular wide repository items with few or zero displayed properties)

---

* failed communication through irrelevant pictures (in UI Cards) 

![](./img/courses_card-items.png)

---

![](./img/page-editor_fake-cards_cate-start.png)

---

* unknown iconography (the empty UI Progress Meter)

---

University of Bern:
* great input from Timon and Yvonne
* funding to further explore this topic

---

#### Information Architecture

---

* not about visual design
* purely a semantic, layered structure

---

* guide a user through layers, branches or funnels to the content or action they intended to find

---

* Relevant data is provided when and where it is expected
* data irrelevant to the current user intent is minimized

---

#### User intent

* describes the user's goal of their current interaction with the interface

---

#### The Users Mental Model

* describes how a user thinks they will get to their goal

---

* **User intent:** pick a course from a category {.fragment .fade-in}
* **mental model:** file manager navigation: {.fragment .fade-in}
    * categories distinguishable from course objects {.fragment .fade-in}
    * clicking on category goes one level deeper in the hierarchy {.fragment .fade-in}
    * Potential mismatch: double-click? {.fragment .fade-in}

---

* information architecture
* user intent
* mental model

From theory to practical application in ILIAS?

---

In ILIAS...

* many different user roles
* dozens of different object types
* vastly different possible actions

---

In ILIAS it's very challenging to

* guess one current user intent
* match their mental model

because many views support more than one purpose or action.

---

## Most relevant models?

What general types of user intents and mental models do we have in ILIAS?

---

* Making a quick choice
* Comparing before choosing
* Managing multiple objects

---

### Making a quick choice

* decide on which of some expected objects to click on (e.g. first semester vs. second semester) {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* only 1 - 2 properties guide this decision {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* most prominent action often is the reason why the user is here {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

---

Example: Contact or Member Gallery

![](./img/contact-gallery.png)

---

### Comparing before choosing

* compare a selection of relevant properties of multiple objects before making a choice between them {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* multiple properties seen as relevant help to make the decision {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* usually there is one prominent action {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

---

Example: Agenda View

![](./img/agenda-view.png)

---

### Managing multiple objects

* administrators or users with a special role {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* want to collect, compare, and modify multiple objects and many of their properties {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* for sorting and bulk processing actions {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

---

Example: User Management

![](./img/user-management.png)

---

Different focus

* Quick choice = 1 - 2 properties
* Comparing before choosing = 3 - 4 properties
* Managing multiple objects = many properties

---

### Tendency of UI components

---

* Quick choice = card

![](./img/courses_card-items.png)

---

* Comparing before choosing = item, presentation table

![](./img/cate-Trainingssuche.png)

---

* Managing multiple objects = table

---

## Strategies

to assist the users with these mental models

---

### User adjusted views

User sets filters and sorting according to their current intent, leaving only (or mostly) the data they wish to work with.

---

Filters for tables and repository items

---

### Curated views

Someone builds a view (or a sequence of views) choosing to include, exclude, deemphasize, and highlight data to support the user by anticipating a single (or a few) selected intents and needs.

---

Managing users build card grids with the page editor

![](./img/page-editor_fake-card-grid.png)

---

### Structured patterns

Semantic grouping

User directs their attention to a section where they expect to consistently find the currently relevant data and actions.

---

Advantage: View doesn't change with user intent, but the user changes their focus.

#### Groups (WIP example)

* featured properties most relevant to most common user intent {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* most important and other actions {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* content detail properties {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* community interaction {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* additional (meta) data {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

---

Decending priorities & learned positions

![](./img/course-item_example-suggested-grouping_prioritization.png)

* 1 & 2: featured properties most relevant to most common user intent {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* A & B: most important and C: other actions {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* 3: content detail properties {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* I.: community interaction {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* 4: additional (meta) data {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

---

Other experiments & ideas

![](./img/course-item_example-suggested-grouping.png)


* Pulling most important action from dropdown as btn-primary {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* Omitting keys when not needed {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* Omitting current year, start or end dates {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
* Omitting registration dates when already registered {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

---

Wild thoughts

* Do properties have to appear on the item? How about in the slate? (screenshot from Nextcloud)

## Next steps

PR to the UI framework docs with the presented UX Guidelines and Models to reference and work with: github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS/pull/4916/ {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

Implement structured patterns in WIP projects e.g [Streamline Object
Properties](https://docu.ilias.de/goto_docu_wiki_wpage_7399_1357.html) {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

Follow-up roadmap and feature requests? {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
