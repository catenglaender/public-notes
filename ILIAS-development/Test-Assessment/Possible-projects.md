# Horizontal and Vertical Drag and Drop questions visual differences

It seems like the items of a vertical drag and drop questions have an (unwanted?) second frame within the box. Horizontal questions only have one box around them. I propose that vertical and horizontal drag items should look the same.

# Left padding in Horizontal Drag and Drop Questions

Is this left padding wanted? It makes reading drag and drop items as one sentence harder.

# Background of h3

A headline within a question text comes with a background color, which looks like a visual glitch in front of the question container. This might be a general behavior we might want to evaluate. With regard to visual simplification, I would recommend that headlines should not have a background color (and if they do it should come from a sourrounding container like a panel header)

# Paragraphs in Tables inside the Test Assessment

The Test Assessment is one of the only places I know that renders p tags into tables. The tables margin causes those paragraphs to be misaligned with a substantial spacing at the top.
