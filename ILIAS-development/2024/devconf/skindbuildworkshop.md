# Custom skins (system styles) in ILIAS 9+

ILIAS' skin Delos has recently been greatly refactored and restructered with many benefits for maintenance and extendability.
In this workshop we explore how advanced skins (system styles) can be set up in ILIAS 9 and beyond building on top of the new structure.
Step by step, we will discover how to modify variables from an entry point of the SCSS skin as well as how to fork Delos completely as a foundation for an advanced skin.
If you can bring a laptop with an ILIAS 9 development environment (e.g. https://github.com/conceptsandtraining/doil), you can follow along and play around with some design elements live.
